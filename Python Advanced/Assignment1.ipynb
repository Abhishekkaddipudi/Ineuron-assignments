    "- In Python, OOP is implemented using classes and objects.\n",
    "- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "- Encapsulation: OOP allows you to encapsulate data and behavior into objects, which helps to prevent accidental modification of data and makes your code more secure.\n",
    "- Inheritance: OOP allows you to create new classes that inherit properties and methods from existing classes, which can help to reduce duplication of code and make your code more organized.\n",
    "- Polymorphism: OOP allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes in a seamless manner, which can make your code more flexible and easier to maintain."
